My personal configurations. For arch-based distributions (they probably work on other distributions too)

# Important

Don't expect these configs to work perfectly unless you have installed all of them, because some configs depend on something brought by another config.
These may not work on your machine for some reason. I won't fix bugs on my configs unless they affect me. These are my configs and they are only guaranteed to work on my machine.

These are available to the public, because I want to easily be able to install these on my own systems without need to log into something.

I don't accept contributions to these configs.

# Installation
`./install.sh` to install configurations and themes automatically.
`./install-tools.sh` to install tools (some from source, some with the package manager) NOTE: I haven't tested this yet.
