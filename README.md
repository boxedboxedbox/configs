My personal configurations. For arch-based distributions (they probably work on other distributions as well though)

# Important

Don't expect these configs to work perfectly unless you have installed all of them, because some configs may depend on something brought by another config
 and I'm too lazy to fix those issues.

These may not work on your machine for some reason. I won't fix bugs on my configs unless they affect me. These are my configs and they are only guaranteed to work on my machine.

These are available to the public, because I want to easily be able to install these on my own systems without need to log into something.

I don't accept contributions to these configs.

# Installation

Edit the configuration in `install.sh` and run it to install configs, tools and themes.
Some may need to be manually moved, such as wallpapers, becasuse I'm lazy.
